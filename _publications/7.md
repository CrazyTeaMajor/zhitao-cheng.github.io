excerpt: 'Zhitao Cheng, Yan Zhuang, Xujia Li, Yuyang Zhuge, Yanlin Leng, Qing Wang, Song Su, Jiayu Huang, Yong Tang. Diagnosis of Cataract of Humancompanion Animals using Deep Learning. Submitted to The Veterinary Journal, under review, 2024. Animals with cataracts suffer from degraded visions and low life quality, meanwhile bringing burdens to owners emotionally and economically. Early discovery and diagnosis of cataracts would help in planning timely treatments. This study presents a two-stage deep learning framework for the diagnosis of cataracts in human-companion animals, specifically cats and dogs. A dedicated large dataset of both face and eye images of cats and dogs containing cataracts and non-cataracts were included in this study. All images were carefully reviewed by experienced veterinary ophthalmologists. Multiple machine learning methods were trained using a cross-validation approach and evaluated in retrospective testing sets.	The deep learning framework could successfully locate the eye regions in face images and accurately classify cataracts with promising accuracies for both animals. For cats, the best AUC values of 0.9939 (95%CI 0.9836-0.9996). For dogs, the best AUC values of 0.9943 (95%CI 0.9885-0.9983). The proposed framework in diagnosing cataracts in human-companion animals has the potential to greatly benefit their health.'
