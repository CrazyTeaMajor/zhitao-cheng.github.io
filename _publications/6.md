excerpt: 'Yao Xiao, Yang Zhao, Wei Wang, Zhitao Cheng, Xizhu Peng, He Tang, Shengping Liu, Yong Tang. Residual Calibration for High-Precision Optical Neural Networks, Optica, under review, 2024. Optical processors have emerged as promising platforms for accelerating matrix vector multiplications (MVMs), offering significant advantages in energy efficiency and low latency for applications such as optical neural networks (ONNs). However, practical errors in existing optical analog architectures limit computational precision and scalability, posing a critical challenge in optical computing. In this study, we propose a novel residual calibration method to achieve high-precision MVMs by leveraging multiple low-precision optical multiplications. We develop a mathematical framework that provides a solid theoretical foundation for the proposed calibration algorithm. Additionally, we fabricate a photonic integrated chip based on Mach-Zehnder interferometers and conduct extensive laboratory experiments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed residual calibration effectively compensates for deviations between practical optical processors and ideal models, significantly improving MVM precision and enhancing ONN accuracy. Specifically, residual calibration increases the ONNâ€™s recognition accuracy on the Fashion-MNIST dataset to levels comparable with corresponding computer models. This calibration method offers a new approach to achieving high-precision computing with optical processors, with significant implications for the development of high-performance ONNs.'
