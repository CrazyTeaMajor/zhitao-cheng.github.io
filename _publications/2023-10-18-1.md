excerpt: 'This research systematically analyzes the behaviors of correlations among stock prices and the eigenvalues for correlation matrices by utilizing random matrix theory (RMT) for Chinese and US stock markets. Results suggest that most eigenvalues of both markets fall within the predicted distribution intervals by RMT, whereas some larger eigenvalues fall beyond the noises and carry market information. The largest eigenvalue represents the market and is a good indicator for averaged correlations. Further, the average largest eigenvalue shows similar movement with the index for both markets. The analysis demonstrates the fraction of eigenvalues falling beyond the predicted interval, pinpointing major market switching points. It has identified that the average of eigenvector components corresponds to the largest eigenvalue switch with the market itself. The investigation on the second largest eigenvalue and its eigenvector suggests that the Chinese market is dominated by four industries whereas the US market contains three leading industries. The study later investigates how it changes before and after a market crash, revealing that the two markets behave differently, and a major market structure change is observed in the Chinese market but not in the US market. The results shed new light on mining hidden information from stock market data.'
